    ----------

        An instance to which this event group is bound, by default None
    name : str, optional
        Optional name for this event group, by default will be the name of the group
        subclass.  (e.g., 'Events' in the example below.)

    Example
    -------
    >>> class Events(SignalGroup):
    ...     sig1 = Signal(str)
    ...     sig2 = Signal(str)
    ...
    >>> events = Events()

    ...     record.args    # the args that were emitted
    ...
    >>> events.connect(some_callback)

    note that the SignalGroup may also be created with `strict=True`, which will

    >>> class Events(SignalGroup, strict=True):

    This will raise an exception

        check_types : bool, optional

        unique : bool or str, optional
            If `True`, returns without connecting if the slot has already been
            connected.  If the literal string "raise" is passed to `unique`, then a

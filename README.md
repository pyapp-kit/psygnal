Pure python implementation of Qt-style Signals, with (optional) signature and type checking, and support for threading.

## Usage

### Install

```sh
pip install psygnal
```

### Basic usage

If you are familiar with the Qt [Signals &
Slots](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/signalsandslots.html) API as implemented in
[PySide](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python_Signals_and_Slots) and
[PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/signals_slots.html),
then you should be good to go!  `psygnal` aims to be a superset of those APIs
(some functions do accept additional arguments, like
[`check_nargs`](#connection-safety-number-of-arguments) and
[`check_types`](#connection-safety-types)).

*Note: the name "`Signal`" is used here instead of `pyqtSignal`, following the
`qtpy` and `PySide` convention.*

```py
from psygnal import Signal

# create an object with class attribute Signals
class MyObj:

    # this signal will emit a single string
    value_changed = Signal(str)

    def __init__(self, value=0):
        self._value = value

    def set_value(self, value):
        if value != self._value:
            self._value = str(value)
            # emit the signal
            self.value_changed.emit(self._value)

def on_value_changed(new_value):
    print(f"The new value is {new_value!r}")

# instantiate the object with Signals
obj = MyObj()

# connect one or more callbacks with `connect`
obj.value_changed.connect(on_value_changed)

# callbacks are called when value changes
obj.set_value('hello!')  # prints: 'The new value is 'hello!'

# disconnect callbacks with `disconnect`
obj.value_changed.disconnect(on_value_changed)
```

### `connect` as a decorator

`.connect()` returns the object that it is passed, and so
can be used as a decorator.

```py
@obj.value_changed.connect
def some_other_callback(value):
    print(f"I also received: {value!r}")

obj.set_value('world!')
# prints:
# I also received: 'world!'
```

### Connection safety (number of arguments)

`psygnal` prevents you from connecting a callback function that is ***guaranteed
to fail*** due to an incompatible number of positional arguments.  For example,
the following callback has too many arguments for our Signal (which we declared
above as emitting a single argument: `Signal(str)`)

```py
def i_require_two_arguments(first, second):
    print(first, second)

obj.value_changed.connect(i_require_two_arguments)
```

raises:

```py
ValueError: Cannot connect slot 'i_require_two_arguments' with signature: (first, second):
- Slot requires at least 2 positional arguments, but spec only provides 1

Accepted signature: (p0: str, /)
```

*Note: Positional argument checking can be disabled with `connect(...,
check_nargs=False)`*

#### Extra positional arguments ignored

While a callback may not require *more* positional arguments than the signature
of the `Signal` to which it is connecting, it *may* accept less.  Extra
arguments will be discarded when emitting the signal (so it
isn't necessary to create a `lambda` to swallow unnecessary arguments):

```py
obj = MyObj()

def no_args_please():
    print(locals())

obj.value_changed.connect(no_args_please)

# otherwise one might need
# obj.value_changed.connect(lambda a: no_args_please())

obj.value_changed.emit('hi')  # prints: "{}"
```

### Connection safety (types)

For type safety when connecting slots, use `check_types=True` when connecting a
callback.  Recall that our signal was declared as accepting a string
`Signal(str)`.  The following function has an incompatible type annotation: `x:
int`.

```py
# this would fail because you cannot concatenate a string and int
def i_expect_an_integer(x: int):
    print(f'{x} + 4 = {x + 4}')

# psygnal won't let you connect it
obj.value_changed.connect(i_expect_an_integer, check_types=True)
```

raises:

```py
ValueError: Cannot connect slot 'i_expect_an_integer' with signature: (x: int):
- Slot types (x: int) do not match types in signal.

Accepted signature: (p0: str, /)
```

*Note: unlike Qt, `psygnal` does **not** perform any type coercion when emitting
a value.*

### Connection safety (object references)

psygnal tries very hard not to hold strong references to connected objects.
In the simplest case, if you connect a bound method as a callback to a signal
instance:

```python
class T:
    def my_method(self):
        ...

obj = T()
signal.connect(t.my_method)
```

Then there is a risk of `signal` holding a reference to `obj` even after `obj`
has been deleted, preventing garbage collection (and possibly causing errors
when the signal is emitted next).  Psygnal avoids this with weak references. It
goes a bit farther, trying to prevent strong references in these cases as well:

- class methods used as the callable in `functools.partial`
- decorated class methods that mangle the name of the callback.

Another common case for leaking strong references is a `partial` closing on an
object, in order to set an attribute:

```python
class T:
    x = 1

obj = T()
signal.connect(partial(setattr, obj, 'x'))  # ref to obj stuck in the connection
```

Here, psygnal offers the `connect_settatr` convenience method, which reduces code
and helps you avoid leaking strong references to `obj`:

```python
signal.connect_setatttr(obj, 'x')
```


### Query the sender

Similar to Qt's [`QObject.sender()`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qobject.html#sender)
method, a callback can query the sender using the `Signal.sender()` class
method.  (The implementation is of course different than Qt, since the receiver
is not a `QObject`.)

```py
obj = MyObj()

def curious():
    print("Sent by", Signal.sender())
    assert Signal.sender() == obj

obj.value_changed.connect(curious)
obj.value_changed.emit(10)

# prints (and does not raise):
# Sent by <__main__.MyObj object at 0x1046a30d0>
```

*If you want the actual signal instance that is emitting the signal
(`obj.value_changed` in the above example), use `Signal.current_emitter()`.*

### Emitting signals asynchronously (threading)

There is experimental support for calling all connected slots in another thread,
using `emit(..., asynchronous=True)`

```py
obj = MyObj()

def slow_callback(arg):
    import time
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(f"Hi {arg!r}, from another thread")

obj.value_changed.connect(slow_callback)
```

This one is called synchronously (note the order of print statements):

```py
obj.value_changed.emit('friend')
print("Hi, from main thread.")

# after 0.5 seconds, prints:
# Hi 'friend', from another thread
# Hi, from main thread.
```

This one is called asynchronously, and immediately returns to the caller.
A `threading.Thread` object is returned.

```py
thread = obj.value_changed.emit('friend', asynchronous=True)
print("Hi, from main thread.")

# immediately prints
# Hi, from main thread.

# then after 0.5 seconds this will print:
# Hi 'friend', from another thread
```

**Note:** The user is responsible for `joining` and managing the
`threading.Thread` instance returned when calling `.emit(...,
asynchronous=True)`.

**Experimental!**  While thread-safety is the goal,
([`RLocks`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#rlock-objects) are
used during important state mutations) it is not guaranteed.  Please use at your
own risk. Issues/PRs welcome.

### Blocking a signal

To temporarily block a signal, use the `signal.blocked()` context context manager:

```py
obj = MyObj()

with obj.value_changed.blocked():
    # do stuff without obj.value_changed getting emitted
    ...
```

To block/unblock permanently (outside of a context manager), use `signal.block()`
and `signal.unblock()`.

### Pausing a signal

Sometimes it is useful to temporarily collect/buffer emission events, and then emit
them together as a single event.  This can be accomplished using the
`signal.pause()`/`signal.resume()` methods, or the `signal.paused()` context manager.

If a function is passed to `signal.paused(func)` (or `signal.resume(func)`) it will
be passed to `functools.reduce` to combine all of the emitted values collected during
the paused period, and a single combined value will be emitted.

```py
obj = MyObj()
obj.value_changed.connect(print)

# note that signal.paused() and signal.resume() accept a reducer function
with obj.value_changed.paused(lambda a,b: (f'{a[0]}_{b[0]}',), ('',)):
    obj.value_changed('a')
    obj.value_changed('b')
    obj.value_changed('c')
# prints '_a_b_c'
```

*NOTE: args passed to `emit` are collected as tuples, so the two arguments
passed to `reducer` will always be tuples. `reducer` must handle that and
return an args tuple.
For example, the three `emit()` events above would be collected as*

```python
[('a',), ('b',), ('c',)]
```

*and would be reduced and re-emitted as follows:*

```python
obj.emit(*functools.reduce(reducer, [('a',), ('b',), ('c',)]))
```

## Other similar libraries

There are other libraries that implement similar event-based signals, they may
server your purposes better depending on what you are doing.

### [PySignal](https://github.com/dgovil/PySignal) (deprecated)

This package borrows inspiration from – and is most similar to – the now
deprecated [PySignal](https://github.com/dgovil/PySignal) project, with a few
notable new features in `psygnal` regarding signature and type checking, sender
querying, and threading.

#### similarities with `PySignal`

- still a "Qt-style" signal implementation that doesn't depend on Qt
- supports class methods, functions, lambdas and partials

#### differences with `PySignal`

- the class attribute `pysignal.ClassSignal` is called simply `Signal` in
  `psygnal` (to more closely match the PyQt/Pyside syntax).  Correspondingly
  `pysignal.Signal` is similar to `psygnal.SignalInstance`.
- Whereas `PySignal` refrained from doing any signature and/or type checking
  either at slot-connection time, or at signal emission time, `psygnal` offers
  signature declaration similar to Qt with , for example, `Signal(int, int)`.
  along with opt-in signature compatibility (with `check_nargs=True`) and type
  checking (with `check_types=True`). `.connect(..., check_nargs=True)` in
  particular ensures that any slot to connected to a signal will at least be
  compatible with the emitted arguments.
- You *can* query the sender in `psygnal` by using the `Signal.sender()` or
  `Signal.current_emitter()` class methods. (The former returns the *instance*
  emitting the signal, similar to Qt's
  [`QObject.sender()`](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qobject.html#sender) method,
  whereas the latter returns the currently emitting `SignalInstance`.)
- There is basic threading support (calling all slots in another thread), using
  `emit(..., asynchronous=True)`.  This is experimental, and while thread-safety
  is the goal, it is not guaranteed.
- There are no `SignalFactory` classes here.

*The following two libraries implement django-inspired signals, they do not
attempt to mimic the Qt API.*

### [Blinker](https://github.com/jek/blinker)

Blinker provides a fast dispatching system that allows any number of interested
parties to subscribe to events, or "signals".

### Debugging

While `psygnal` is a pure python module, it is compiled with Cython to increase
performance.  To import `psygnal` in uncompiled mode, without deleting the
shared library files from the psyngal module, set the environment variable
`PSYGNAL_UNCOMPILED` before importing psygnal.  The `psygnal._compiled` variable
will tell you if you're running the compiled library or not.
